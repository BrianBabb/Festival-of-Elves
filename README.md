## What is Festival of the Elves? 

Purpose of the app: Is to make it easy for parents to create Christmas magic for their kids. 

The experience can be solely online and or combined online and offline experience for parents and kids. Parents can send personalized message to the kids with their kids' name and with their choice of elves' name on the card on each day.

Post creating a profile parent are assigned two elves that provide them 25 days worth of activities to do with their kids over the holiday season. The elves’ notes can be delivered to the kids each morning via the Kid view on the app or printed out for the parents to hide in an Advent calendar box or in any box.
