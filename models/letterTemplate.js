  <p>When Santa told us we would be your elves for the festival of the elves we were Sooooooooo EXCITED. Our names are <span id='childOne'> and </span><span id='childTwo'></span>. We will bring you Christmas cheer and fun this year. We left you dolls that look like us, so first thing to do is give us a hug.</p>
  <br></br>
  <p>Festival of the Elves is a magical time. It's about having fun with your family and for being kind.Each day you will find a special note left behind. Today is our first and we are just about to burst. </p>
  <br></br>
  <p>Before we say goodbye there are three things to try.
    1. Please make us a drawing for our workshop. We'll pick it up when we leave your note tomorrow.
    2. Spin around three times.
    3. Give someone you love a hug.
